This project is a Bangla text summarization using FlanT5 and mT5, trained on the XLSum dataset and fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 21,512 rows categorized into seven domains, with state and international being the most frequent. Domain adaptation was applied to state, international, and sports categories. FlanT5 performed best in fine-tuning, achieving ROUGE 0.79 and BERTScore 0.86 in the state domain, while mT5 excelled in zero-shot scenarios, showing strong adaptability. The international domain recorded the highest zero-shot performance with FlanT5, achieving ROUGE 0.67, BLEU 0.47, and BERTScore 0.89. This project enhances Bangla NLP by enabling efficient, domain-specific summarization, making it useful for a wide range of users, including researchers, professionals, content creators, and AI-driven applications.
